# sync-emacs-config
Just simple PowerShell and BASH scripts to keep my local Emacs configuration up to date.

The scripts will probably be messy and not well written (Especially the PowerShell script, since I've started learning PowerShell just recently), but they work (and that's all I need :laughing:)

For now, I've added the BASH script to the list of Startup Applications on all my Linux machines (and the PowerShell script on one Windows machine), and set it to run when I login. In the future I'll probably find a better way to do this (probably with another script :laughing:)
