# sync-emacs-config
Just a simple BASH script to keep my local Emacs configuration up to date.

The script will probably be messy and not well written, but it works (and that's all I need :laughing:)

For now, I've added this script to the list of Startup Applications on all my Linux machines, and set it to run when I login. In the future I'll probably find a better way to do this (probably with another script :laughing:)
